# Precautions
The following-mentioned flashing operation requires your familiarity with Linux and firmware flashing.   
**Please do not attempt to try it without sufficient experience!**  
**Please do not attempt to try it without sufficient experience!**  
**Please do not attempt to try it without sufficient experience!**  

as we will not be held responsible for any consequences. Thank you for your understanding.

once you flashed the new firmware, there is no going back
even if you switch id from 9011 to 9001 ,mmcli may  not able to see the 4G modem any more.

Therefore, there are risks involved in flashing the 4g ext, and it is necessary for you to have a certain understanding of these background information. During the testing process, it is also not possible for me to test whether all SIM cards worldwide can easily connect to the internet through **usb0**.

# Purpose

A more convenient way to use 4G ext on the uConsole,no setup, no nmcli ,just insert 4G card and power on 4G ext, that's it

# Power On 4G ext

we assume that you already know how to power on the 4G ext by https://github.com/clockworkpi/uConsole/wiki/How-to-use-the-4G-extension

if not ,these steps are not safe for your device

# Checking usb id
```
sudo lsusb

Bus 001 Device 009: ID 1e0e:9001 Qualcomm / Option SimTech, Incorporated
```

OR AT COMMAND

```
echo -en "AT+CUSBPIDSWITCH?\r\n" | sudo socat - /dev/ttyUSB2,crnl
```


we expecting response contains **9001**, not 9011

# Flashing part

if you got **9001** from

```
echo -en "AT+CUSBPIDSWITCH?\r\n" | sudo socat - /dev/ttyUSB2,crnl
```

then you can try to upgrade firmware to give a shot for **usb0** way of connecting 4G network

**All processess  done on uConsole CM4 or A06**


## Process Summary:

Download whole package from 

https://github.com/clockworkpi/uConsole/raw/master/Bin/4G/LE20B04SIM7600G22_cpi_arm64.tar.gz

and uncompress it of course

```
tar zxvf LE20B04SIM7600G22_cpi_arm64.tar.gz
cd LE20B04SIM7600G22_cpi_arm64
```

First, send the command `AT+BOOTLDR` to **/dev/ttyUSB3** to put the device into bootloader mode. At this point, the LED on the back will not light up.

```
echo -en  "AT+BOOTLDR\r\n" |sudo socat - /dev/ttyUSB3,crnl
```

Next, use `sudo ./fastboot/bin/fastboot devices` to ensure that the device is detected. It should display something like `MDM9607 fastboot`.   
If there is no device information, the operation must be halted.

Then, use `./flash.sh` from the compressed package to flash the firmware, which should take about **40** seconds.

here is the output of flash.sh

```

```

Once the flashing is completed, the device will automatically reboot, and the LED on the back will light up again.

At this point, run `sudo dmesg |tail` to check for the following output:
```
[ 1033.836166] option 1-1.3:1.2: GSM modem (1-port) converter detected
[ 1033.836636] usb 1-1.3: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB0

[ 1033.840949] usb 1-1.3: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB4
```

If you see this output, it means that the firmware has been successfully flashed and the module is not bricked.  

Next, modify the USB ID of the module using AT commands:

`echo -en "AT+CUSBPIDSWITCH=9011,1,1\r\n" | sudo socat - /dev/ttyUSB2,crnl`  

If you receive an `OK` response, the device will automatically reboot. Wait for the LED to flash again.  

Finally, run `sudo dmesg | tail` to check for the following output:  

```
[ 1033.836166] option 1-1.3:1.2: GSM modem (1-port) converter detected
[ 1033.836636] usb 1-1.3: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB0

[ 1033.956181] usbcore: registered new interface driver rndis_host
[ 1033.966622] usbcore: registered new interface driver rndis_wlan

```
now you can see 9011 in lsusb
```
cpi@raspberrypi:~/LE20B04SIM7600G22_cpi $ sudo lsusb
Bus 001 Device 008: ID 1e0e:9011 Qualcomm / Option SimTech, Incorporated
```
and `sudo ifconfig usb0`

So, the appearance of usb0 indicates success.

In fact, at this point, if the SIM card is inserted correctly, the 4G network should already be connected.

to test if the 4G connection is ok by
```
cpi@raspberrypi:~/LE20B04SIM7600G22_cpi $ ping -I usb0 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) from ***.***.***.** usb0: 56(84) bytes of data.
