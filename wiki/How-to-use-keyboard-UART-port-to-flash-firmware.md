On uConsole keyboard back,there is a **UART** port which can be used with `stm32flash` to flash keyboard stock firmware  

Especially when your keyboard met problem  

here is the process:  

* put the switch 1 ON
* connect uart with a **fpc 6p connector 0.5mm** to a serial-usb converter
* use stm32flash to flash bin file
* put the switch 1 OFF

Do not forget to **also connect GND** (ground) between the fpc 6p connector and the serial-usb converter.

## Flashing command

```
$ sudo stm32flash -w uconsole.kbd.0.4_48mhz.bin -v -S 0x08000000 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
You can get uconsole.kbd.0.4_48mhz.bin from https://github.com/clockworkpi/uConsole/tree/master/Bin

## Normal flashing output
```
stm32flash 0.5
